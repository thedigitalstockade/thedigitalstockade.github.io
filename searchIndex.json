		"content": "About\nI am a PhD researcher who uses digital techniques to explore Australian Colonial convict management systems. This site however is less about my research (although you may get snippets from time to time) and more about the digital tools and techniques that I use (or bump into) that may also assist you in your own Archaeological, Digital Humanities or History research.\nI do not intend to write in depth tutorials on programming languages or methods (There are much better tutors on the web for advanced programming methods than me), but rather to produce a grab-bag of practical examples to ‘lower the barrier of entry’ to digital techniques for new and existing researchers so that you may add them to your repertoire and start exploring the past in new ways.\nI won’t do your homework or research for you, but if you have genuine questions please feel free to reach out via the form on the contact page.",
